## If you have same PS4 hardware as me you can use these files from below:

- [bootargs.txt] MD5 >__C84AD779CE76762C04CBF80E420E324D__
- [initramfs.cpio.gz] MD5 >__951549B1DEB59DAE3ADA8038461BADD2__

- [arch.tar.xz] MD5 >__7A997C14B2FAD0C839107A07C69FC312__


# TODO LIST

- RPCS3 emulator - PS3 emulator. (You can try with the AppImage in their [website.](https://rpcs3.net/download))
- ProtonDB play windows games on linux.
- Nothing more, you tell me.

# KNOW ISSUES

Not sure why but every time you boot in to linux, you have to set your current time and date, just type the following commands on terminal as root: 

>__# timedatectl set-time "yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss"__

For example:

>__# timedatectl set-time "2022-02-19 13:13:54"__

Not sure why but every time you boot in to linux, you have to set to unpair and pair again your PS4 controller in every boot.
